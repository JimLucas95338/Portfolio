### 3. **[AI Content Optimization Platform](./AI-Content-Optimization-Platform/)**
*March 2025 - May 2025*

**What I Built:**
Built this after getting frustrated with how much time I was spending optimizing LinkedIn posts. Turns out there's a real market for AI-powered content optimization. This shows iterative product development and user-centered design.

**The Story:**
Personal pain point became a product. I was spending 30+ minutes per LinkedIn post trying to optimize for engagement. Built an AI tool that does it in 30 seconds. The key insight was platform-specific optimization.

**What I Learned:**
Users don't want to become social media experts, they just want their content to perform better. Hide the complexity, show the results.

---

### 4. **[Value-Based Care Analytics](./Value-Based-Care-Analytics/)**
*December 2024 - February 2025*

**What I Built:**
Deep dive into value-based care analytics. Built dashboards and tools that help healthcare providers manage population health and hit quality targets. This one's all about healthcare economics.

**The Story:**
Spent months understanding how value-based care actually works (it's complicated). The breakthrough was realizing providers need actionable signals, not just data dashboards.

**What I Learned:**
Healthcare analytics is only valuable if it changes clinical workflow. Pretty charts don't save lives, actionable insights do.

---

### 5. **[Digital Therapeutics Case Study](./Digital-Therapeutics-Case-Study/)**
*September 2024 - November 2024*

**What I Built:**
Comprehensive case study exploring digital therapeutics for mental health. Deep dive into regulated medical devices and FDA approval processes. Shows strategic thinking for complex, regulated markets.

**The Story:**
Wanted to understand how to build medical devices that are actually software. The regulatory landscape is intense, but the patient impact potential is huge.

**What I Learned:**
Digital therapeutics isn't just "health apps" it's actual medicine. The regulatory bar is high for good reason.

---

### 6. **[FHIR API Integration Demo](./FHIR-API-Integration-Demo/)**
*June 2024 - August 2024*

**What I Built:**
Practical implementation of FHIR APIs for healthcare data exchange. Built this to really understand healthcare interoperability beyond just talking about it.

**The Story:**
Healthcare interoperability is a mess, but FHIR is supposed to fix it. Built actual working integrations to understand what's possible vs. what's promised.

**What I Learned:**
Healthcare data standards exist, but implementation is where things get tricky. Every EHR does FHIR slightly differently.

---

### 7. **[Healthcare Data Dashboard](./Healthcare-Data-Dashboard/)**
*March 2024 - May 2024*

**What I Built:**
Interactive dashboard for healthcare analytics. My first real dive into healthcare data visualization and KPIs.

**The Story:**
Started simple - just wanted to understand healthcare data better. Ended up building a full analytics platform.

**What I Learned:**
Healthcare data is messy and full of edge cases. Good analytics requires deep domain knowledge, not just technical skills.

---

### 8. **[AI Product Strategy Framework](./AI-Product-Strategy-Framework.md)**
*August 2025 - Present*

**What I Built:**
Comprehensive framework for AI product management covering strategy, execution, and measurement. Demonstrates deep understanding of how to build AI products that deliver real business value while maintaining ethical standards and user trust.

**The Story:**
After working with AI in multiple projects, I wanted to create a systematic approach to AI product management. The framework addresses the unique challenges of building AI products - from ethics and bias detection to user experience design and success measurement.

**What I Learned:**
AI product management requires a different approach than traditional product management. You need to think about model performance, bias detection, user trust, and ethical considerations from day one. The framework provides a structured approach to these complex challenges.

## What's Next

I'm passionate about the intersection of AI and healthcare. The potential to improve patient outcomes through intelligent technology is huge, but it requires deep understanding of both domains.

Currently exploring opportunities in Senior AI Product Manager roles where I can combine my healthcare expertise with cutting-edge AI capabilities.
