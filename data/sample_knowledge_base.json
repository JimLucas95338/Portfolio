They are crucial for AI applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and similarity matching. Vector databases use advanced indexing techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) and FAISS to enable fast approximate nearest neighbor searches across millions or billions of vectors. Unlike traditional databases that store structured data, vector databases excel at finding semantically similar content based on embedding representations. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, and Qdrant. They enable applications like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), where relevant context is retrieved before generating responses.",

The RAG pipeline typically involves document chunking, embedding generation, vector storage, similarity search, and context-aware generation.

    "content": "Semantic search represents a significant advancement over traditional keyword-based search by understanding the meaning and context of queries rather than just matching words. Traditional search relies on exact keyword matching and basic ranking algorithms like TF-IDF, which can miss relevant results that use different terminology. Semantic search uses machine learning and natural language processing to understand query intent, context, and relationships between concepts. It leverages techniques like word embeddings, transformer models, and knowledge graphs to find semantically similar content even when exact keywords don't match. This enables more intuitive search experiences where users can ask questions naturally and receive relevant results. Semantic search is particularly valuable for enterprise knowledge management, where context and domain expertise are crucial.",
