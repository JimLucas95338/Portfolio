# Executive Summary

**Project Period:** September - November 2024  
**Product Manager:** Jim Lucas  
**Focus Area:** Digital therapeutics for Type 2 Diabetes management

**GlucoTrack Digital Therapeutics** is a comprehensive product case study designed to demonstrate strategic product management for regulated healthcare technology. This project showcases end-to-end product development methodology, from market analysis and user research to regulatory strategy and go-to-market execution.

Leveraging synthetic data, we developed a dashboard that visualizes key health metrics such as average glucose levels, medication adherence, and app engagement. These insights inform both patient self-management and clinician interventions, highlighting the value of real-time data in improving outcomes.

The product strategy focuses on seamless integration with wearables and EHRs, a user-friendly mobile experience, and actionable insights powered by AI. Our roadmap prioritizes rapid MVP development, clinician dashboard features, and expansion to broader populations.

A robust go-to-market plan targets partnerships with clinics and employer wellness programs, while success metrics include user engagement, adherence improvement, and satisfaction rates. Early pilot results (simulated) suggest a 20% improvement in adherence and high user satisfaction.

This project showcases my ability to blend product vision, user-centric design, data analytics, and AI strategy to address real-world healthcare challenges. It reflects a commitment to responsible innovation and measurable impact in the digital health space.
