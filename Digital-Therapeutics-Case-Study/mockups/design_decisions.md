# Design Decisions - Digital Therapeutics Platform

## üè• Clinical User Interface Design

**Project Period:** September - November 2024  
**Product Manager:** Jim Lucas  
**Design Focus:** Patient engagement and clinical workflow integration

### **Core Design Challenge**
Developing a therapeutic application interface that balances patient engagement with clinical efficacy requirements while ensuring regulatory compliance for medical device classification.

## üë• User Research Findings

### **Patient Interviews (n=12)**

**Primary Pain Points:**
- "Another app? I already have 15 health apps I don't use"
- "I forget to log my symptoms every day"  
- "The interface feels like medical equipment - cold and intimidating"
- "I want to feel like I'm getting better, not just tracking problems"

**Key Insight:** Patients don't want a "medical app" - they want a **wellness companion**

### **Clinician Interviews (n=8)**

**Primary Requirements:**
- "I need to see patient progress trends, not raw data dumps"
- "Alerts for concerning patterns, but not false alarms"
- "Must integrate with our EMR system"
- "Compliance data needs to be exportable for insurance"

**Key Insight:** Clinicians want **actionable insights**, not more data to review

## üé® Design Philosophy

### **For Patients: "Wellness, Not Medical"**

**Visual Approach:**
- Warm colors (soft blues, greens) not clinical white
- Celebration of progress, not just tracking deficits  
- Simple language ("How are you feeling?" not "Rate your symptoms 1-10")
- Personal avatar/companion that grows with progress

**Interaction Design:**
- One-tap logging (not forms)
- Smart defaults based on patterns
- Encouragement messaging
- Streak tracking for motivation

### **For Clinicians: "Signal, Not Noise"**

**Dashboard Approach:**
- Traffic light system: Green (good), Yellow (watch), Red (action needed)
- Trend arrows showing direction of change
- Exception reporting (only show patients who need attention)
- Quick action buttons for common responses

## üì± Patient App Design Decisions

### **Home Screen Strategy**
**Daily Check-in Widget**
- Single question: "How's your day going?" with emoji response
- Background changes color based on mood trends
- Celebration badges for consistency

**Progress Visualization**
- Weekly "mountain climb" metaphor showing improvement
- Not medical charts - more like fitness app progress
- Achievements unlock as they hit milestones

**Medication Reminders**
- Friendly notifications: "Time for your wellness boost!" 
- Not clinical: "Take medication X, 10mg"
- Smart scheduling based on actual adherence patterns

### **Symptom Tracking Simplification**
**Instead of:** Traditional 1-10 pain scales
**We chose:** Visual body map with tap-to-indicate pain areas

**Instead of:** Long daily questionnaires  
**We chose:** Smart questions that adapt based on previous responses

**Instead of:** Clinical terminology
**We chose:** Plain language ("trouble sleeping" not "sleep disturbance")

## üíª Clinician Dashboard Design

### **Patient Overview Screen**
**Priority Patients Section**
- Red alerts: Missed doses 3+ days, significant symptom increase
- Yellow warnings: Declining adherence trends, missed appointments
- Green status: On track, improving metrics

**Individual Patient View**
**Trend Cards (not charts):**
- Medication adherence: "89% this month ‚Üë (was 76%)"
- Symptom severity: "Improving ‚Üó (3 good days this week)"  
- Engagement: "Daily check-ins: 6/7 days"

**Quick Actions:**
- Send encouragement message
- Schedule follow-up call
- Adjust treatment plan
- Export progress report

## üîÑ Integration Challenges & Solutions

### **EMR Integration Reality**
**Challenge:** Every health system uses different EMR software
**Solution:** HL7 FHIR standard APIs + manual CSV export as backup

**Challenge:** Clinicians don't want another system to check
**Solution:** Weekly summary emails + critical alerts only

### **FDA Compliance Requirements**
**Challenge:** Medical device regulations for therapeutic apps
**Solution:** Evidence-based content + clinical trial data collection built-in

**Challenge:** HIPAA security requirements
**Solution:** End-to-end encryption + audit logs for all data access

## üìä User Testing Results

### **Patient App Testing (n=24)**

**Usability Metrics:**
- Time to complete daily check-in: 45 seconds (target: <60s)
- Feature discovery rate: 78% found key features without help
- 7-day retention: 67% (industry average: 25%)

**Feedback Themes:**
‚úÖ "Feels encouraging, not judgmental"
‚úÖ "Actually want to open it each day"  
‚úÖ "My doctor can see I'm trying"
‚ùå "Wish it connected with my Apple Health data"
‚ùå "Notifications sometimes feel pushy"

### **Clinician Dashboard Testing (n=12)**

**Workflow Integration:**
- Average time to review patient status: 2.3 minutes (was 8 minutes)
- Ability to identify at-risk patients: 94% accuracy
- Satisfaction with progress visualization: 4.6/5

**Feature Requests:**
- Bulk actions for multiple patients
- Custom alert thresholds per patient  
- Integration with appointment scheduling

## üéØ Design Validation

### **Clinical Outcomes**
**6-Month Pilot Results:**
- Patient adherence improvement: 34% average increase
- Clinician efficiency: 40% reduction in chart review time
- Patient satisfaction: 4.4/5 vs 3.1/5 for standard care

### **Business Metrics**
- Patient retention at 30 days: 71% (target: 60%)
- Clinician adoption rate: 83% after training
- Support ticket volume: 0.3 per user per month

## üí° Key Design Learnings

### **What Worked**
1. **Wellness framing over medical framing** - patients engaged more
2. **Exception-based clinician alerts** - reduced alert fatigue
3. **Celebration of small wins** - improved long-term adherence
4. **Mobile-first design** - 89% of patient interactions on mobile

### **What We'd Change**
1. **Better onboarding flow** - still too clinical feeling initially
2. **More customization options** - patients want personal control
3. **Family/caregiver involvement** - missing key stakeholder
4. **Offline capability** - connectivity issues in rural areas

## üöÄ Future Design Considerations

### **Emerging Needs**
- Voice interface for accessibility
- AI-powered symptom pattern recognition
- Social support features (patient communities)
- Telehealth integration for crisis intervention

### **Scalability Challenges**
- Multi-language support for diverse populations
- Cultural adaptation for different healthcare systems
- Age-appropriate interfaces (pediatric vs geriatric)
- Condition-specific customization (depression vs diabetes vs ADHD)

**This design approach prioritizes real user needs and clinical workflow integration over aesthetic perfection - exactly what healthcare digital therapeutics require for successful adoption.**
