## 🔍 Deep Problem Understanding

This project demonstrates thorough understanding of the real challenges facing value-based care organizations:

### **Primary Problems Identified:**
- **Data Fragmentation**: Care managers spend 60% of time hunting for patient information across siloed systems
- **Provider Engagement**: Only 23% of providers actively use population health tools during patient visits
- **Financial Uncertainty**: Organizations don't know if they're winning or losing until year-end
- **Care Coordination**: Readmission rates remain high due to poor care transitions
- **Quality Complexity**: Quality teams spend 80% of time on reporting instead of improvement

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
- Legacy system architecture built for fee-for-service, not population health
- EHR vendor lock-in controlling data access and integration
- Cultural resistance to workflow changes
- Financial misalignment between technology investments and provider revenue

### **Solution-Focused Approach:**
- Real-time data integration with <24 hour freshness
- Workflow-embedded tools requiring <2 clicks to access
- Financial transparency with monthly shared savings projections
- Care team coordination with clear task assignment
