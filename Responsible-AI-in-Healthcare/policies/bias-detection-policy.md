# Bias Detection Policy for Healthcare AI Systems

## Policy Statement
Healthcare AI bias isn't optional to address - it's a patient safety issue that can also get your organization into serious regulatory trouble. This policy outlines what we've learned works for catching and fixing bias before it harms patients or lands us in front of regulators.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All AI/ML models used in clinical decision support
- Predictive analytics systems affecting patient care
- Population health management tools
- Clinical research AI applications
- Third-party AI healthcare solutions

## Regulatory Basis
- **FDA Guidance**: Software as Medical Device (SaMD) guidelines
- **HIPAA**: Non-discrimination in healthcare delivery
- **ACA Section 1557**: Prohibition of discrimination in health programs
- **ISO/IEC 23053**: Framework for AI bias assessment

## Mandatory Bias Detection Procedures

### 1. Pre-Deployment Assessment

#### Data Bias Audit (Required for all models)
```
Timeline: Before model development begins
Responsibility: Data Science Team + Clinical SMEs
Deliverable: Data Bias Assessment Report

What we're actually looking for:
✓ Are all patient groups represented in our data?
✓ What historical biases are baked into this dataset?
✓ How was this data collected and by whom?
✓ Which groups have more missing data and why?
✓ Are labels consistent across demographic groups?
```

#### Protected Attribute Identification
**Mandatory Protected Classes:**
- Race/Ethnicity (per OMB standards)
- Gender/Sex
- Age groups (pediatric, adult, geriatric)
- Geographic region
- Insurance type/socioeconomic status
- Language preference
- Disability status

**Healthcare-Specific Attributes:**
- Comorbidity burden
- Healthcare utilization history
- Provider type/setting
- Clinical complexity score

#### Statistical Bias Testing
```python
# Required statistical tests (minimum)
1. Chi-square tests for categorical outcome distributions
2. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for continuous distributions  
3. Permutation tests for group differences
4. Multiple comparison corrections (Bonferroni/FDR)

# Required effect size calculations
1. Cohen's d for continuous outcomes
2. Cramér's V for categorical associations
3. Odds ratios with confidence intervals
4. Number needed to treat/harm by group
```

### 2. Model Development Monitoring

#### Training Phase Requirements
- **Stratified Sampling**: Mandatory balanced representation in train/validation/test sets
- **Feature Audit**: Systematic review of potential proxy variables
- **Performance Tracking**: Group-specific metrics calculated at each training iteration

#### Validation Requirements
```
Required Fairness Metrics (All must be calculated):

Individual Fairness:
- Counterfactual fairness assessment
- Individual discrimination detection

Group Fairness:
- Demographic parity (±5% tolerance)
- Equal opportunity (±3% tolerance)  
- Equalized odds (±3% tolerance)
- Calibration analysis (R² > 0.95 per group)
- Predictive value parity
```

#### Performance Thresholds
| Metric | Minimum Threshold | Action Required |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Demographic Parity Difference** | ≤ 5% | Acceptable |
| **Equal Opportunity Difference** | ≤ 3% | Acceptable |
| **Calibration R²** | ≥ 0.95 per group | Acceptable |
| **AUC Difference** | ≤ 0.05 between groups | Acceptable |
| **Any threshold exceeded** | N/A | Bias mitigation required |

### 3. Deployment Monitoring

#### Real-Time Bias Detection
```
Automated Monitoring Requirements:

Data Drift Detection:
- Population Stability Index (PSI) monitoring
- Feature distribution shift detection  
- Outcome distribution monitoring
- Alert threshold: PSI > 0.2

Performance Drift Detection:
- Group-specific accuracy tracking
- Fairness metric monitoring
- Clinical outcome correlation analysis
- Alert threshold: >5% degradation in any fairness metric
```

#### Monitoring Dashboard Requirements
**Executive Dashboard (Monthly)**
- High-level fairness metric trends
- Regulatory compliance status
- Incident summary and resolution
- Business impact assessment

**Technical Dashboard (Weekly)**
- Detailed bias metric calculations
- Statistical significance testing
- Data quality indicators
- Model performance by subgroup

**Clinical Dashboard (Daily)**
- Patient care impact metrics
- Provider feedback integration
- Adverse event correlation
- Override pattern analysis

### 4. Bias Incident Response

#### Severity Classification
**Level 1 - Critical (Drop Everything Mode)**
- The AI is actively discriminating against patients
- We could face regulatory action or lawsuits
- Response time: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- Actions: Turn off the system, wake up executives

**Level 2 - High (All Hands On Deck)**
- Performance differs significantly between patient groups (>10%)
- Clinical outcomes show disparities that could be AI-related
- Response time: 2 hours
- Actions: Enhanced monitoring, start planning fixes

**Level 3 - Medium**
- Moderate fairness metric deviation (5-10%)
- Provider concerns about bias
- Response time: 24 hours
- Actions: Investigation, stakeholder notification

**Level 4 - Low**
- Minor metric fluctuations (<5%)
- Data quality issues
- Response time: 1 week
- Actions: Documentation, trend monitoring

#### Response Procedures
```
Incident Response Workflow:

1. Detection (Automated/Manual)
   └→ Severity assessment
   
2. Immediate Response (based on severity)
   ├→ System controls (disable if critical)
   ├→ Stakeholder notification
   └→ Documentation initiation
   
3. Investigation (2-48 hours)
   ├→ Root cause analysis
   ├→ Impact assessment
   └→ Mitigation strategy development
   
4. Resolution (1-30 days)
   ├→ Bias mitigation implementation
   ├→ Validation testing
   └→ Phased re-deployment
   
5. Post-Incident Review (within 30 days)
   ├→ Lessons learned documentation
   ├→ Policy/procedure updates
   └→ Staff training updates
```
