    "## What is Patient Readmission Prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patient readmission** occurs when a patient returns to the hospital within 30 days of being discharged. This is a critical healthcare challenge because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Impact**: Readmissions cost the U.S. healthcare system over $26 billion annually\n",
    "- **Quality Indicator**: High readmission rates often indicate gaps in care quality\n",
    "- **Patient Safety**: Frequent readmissions can signal underlying health issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Machine Learning Helps:**\n",
    "Think of our AI model like a very sophisticated calculator that looks at many patient factors (age, medications, length of stay, etc.) and calculates the likelihood that a patient might need to come back to the hospital soon. This helps doctors and nurses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify High-Risk Patients**: Focus extra attention on patients most likely to return\n",
    "2. **Personalize Care Plans**: Tailor discharge planning and follow-up care\n",
    "3. **Prevent Readmissions**: Intervene early with additional support and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Approach:**\n",
    "We use a \"Random Forest\" algorithm - imagine having 100 medical experts each looking at a patient's information and voting on whether they think the patient will be readmitted. The final prediction is based on the majority vote of these 100 \"experts.\"\n"

    "3. **Testing Phase**: We test the model on the remaining 20% of patients (4 patients) it has never seen before\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Random Forest?**\n",
    "- **Robust**: Less likely to make mistakes than simpler models\n",
    "- **Interpretable**: We can understand which factors are most important\n",
    "- **Handles Complex Patterns**: Can find non-obvious relationships in the data\n",

    "**What Happens During Training:**\n",
    "The model analyzes each patient's characteristics and learns which combinations of factors typically lead to readmission.\n"
