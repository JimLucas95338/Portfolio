# Advanced AI/ML dependencies (optional - enables production mode)
# Uncomment and install these for full AI functionality:
# sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
# transformers>=4.21.0
# faiss-cpu>=1.7.0  # or faiss-gpu for GPU support
# chromadb>=0.4.0
# torch>=1.12.0

# Development dependencies (optional)
# jupyter>=1.0.0
# notebook>=6.4.0

# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Basic demo mode (current): No additional installation needed
# 2. Full AI mode: pip install -r requirements.txt (uncomment AI libraries first)
# 3. Development mode: pip install jupyter notebook (for notebooks)

# Note: The application automatically detects available libraries and falls back
# to simulation mode when AI libraries are not installed. This ensures the
# portfolio demo works immediately without complex setup.
