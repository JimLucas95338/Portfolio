## ðŸ’¡ Design Rationale

### Why These Design Choices?

**Search-First Interface**: Unlike traditional enterprise tools that bury search functionality, we made it the primary interface element.

**Confidence Scoring**: Enterprise users need to trust their results. Visual confidence indicators help users quickly assess result quality.

**Rich Metadata**: Showing author, department, and last-modified date helps users judge relevance and authority.

**Mobile Optimization**: 67% of enterprise searches happen outside the office. Mobile interface ensures consistent experience.
