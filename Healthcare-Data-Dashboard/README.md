# Healthcare Data Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization for healthcare data, focusing on patient outcomes, resource utilization, and actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Objectives
- Analyze healthcare data to uncover trends and insights
- Visualize key metrics (e.g., readmission rates, costs, outcomes)
- Communicate findings to technical and non-technical audiences

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Sample datasets
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization
- `dashboard/` – Exported charts or dashboard files
- `docs/` – Documentation and reports

## Getting Started
1. Install Python and required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the example notebook in `notebooks/` and run the cells.
3. Review exported charts in the `dashboard/` folder.

## Example Analyses
- Age distribution
- Readmission rates
- Cost and outcome comparisons by diagnosis

## Executive Summary
See `docs/executive-summary.md` for a summary of key findings.
